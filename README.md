# Brainstorms

The high-level and student-friendly question is: are people biased or do we make them biased?

## OBSERVATIONAL LEARNING

In general, we think that the inverse base-rate effect arises from how you organize information (observed contingencies of events) in response to external events. In order to distinguish between categories, you try to identify category-specific features of the exemplars because you need to reduce error.

Participants are allowed to terminate learning.

## OPERANT BASE-RATE LEARNING

This would be a sort of a information sampling version of the IBRE.

The crucial ingredient for the formation of learning traps is generalization
from experience that *traps* people into premature exploitative behaviours and
limits further learning and belief revision.

The reason we don't expect the effect to appear is because of the lack of need
to distinguish between categories. Maybe the serial nature of the task is what
drives the effect.
