       The study aimed to see if the inverse base-rate effect was present in this
       simple experiment.
       Using the previous work of Kruschke (1996) and Lamberts & Kent (2007),
       we hypothesise that no inverse base rate will be evident, due to the lack
       of cognitive load being presented during the study.

       <br><br>If you wish to withdraw your data from the study, please email either the
       researchers or the project supervisor, Andy Wills.
       If you choose to do this, all of your data will be deleted and destroyed,
       If you are concerned about your psychological well-being after the study,
       please either contact the researchers, project supervisor or the university
       well-being team.
